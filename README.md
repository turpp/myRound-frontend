<p>
    myRound is a stat tracker for your round of golf. Its designed to be light weight and easy to use. Most stat trackers require either to much time to fill out mid round or gives you to much useless infomration. myRound fixes this by having a quick interface and a simple review screen
</p>

## Usage
<p>
Before your round of golf make sure to enter how many holes you are planning on playing. For each hole select the drop down and this will show you an image of a fairway and green. To mark where your drive hit the fairway just tap inside the image. Anything in the middle is a fairway and anything on the sides is the rough. The green works in the same way. You can determine how far each circle is. Just make sure to keep it the same for each hole. Then enter your puts and score. myRound will calculate the puts, score, fairway percentage and green in regulation percentage for you. After you round is over submit the round and view your summary page. You can note the round number and reference it later.
